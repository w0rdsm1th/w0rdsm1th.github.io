Hello and welcome to my personal blog! Thanks for stopping by.

A flexible framework is an idea of programming nirvana. The application structure, pattern and approach is _just right_. It is flexible enough to meet as-yet unknown extensions but rigid and framework-y enough to meet the current challenge.
I suppose this concept applies beyond programming: you don't want to over-engineer but you want something nice to use and performant.

The extension (.xyz) is because it is multi-dimensional (geddit, cartesian co-ordinate axes) and conveniently also one of the cheapest domain name extensions available from my DNS provider.

Its also hopefully flexible enough of a name to cover my as-yet-unknown future interests: unicycle polo anyone?

Some words [about me](about/).
