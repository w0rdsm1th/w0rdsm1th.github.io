  review of "programming paradigms" by Van Roy
excerpt: my literature review of [Peter Van Roy's chapter "programming paradigms for dummies"]("\assets\1902 programming paradigms\Programming Paradigms for dummies - VanRoy.pdf")
tags: [programming, computer science]

I first saw this chapter linked on Hacker News and had this on my reading list ever since.

\*Excitingly the excellently curated and written "Morning Paper" recently did a review of this very paper!
https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/01/25/programming-paradigms-for-dummies-what-every-programmer-should-know/

Reader objectives from this post:
- Lite intro to programming paradigms and why they matter
- ... otherwise they are a little thin, sorry. This blog post mainly to help _me_ internalise and digest this chapter.


# Programming Paradigms for Dummies: or "Language Design Features and Functionality FTW"

I read the boldly titled "[Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf)" recently and wanted to share its lessons.

Why interest?
- Improving as a programmer. Can learn about
  - Algorithms: O(n)
  - Hardware:
  - Data structures:
**and paradigms encompass all of these**
- Object oriented cannot not be the best solution to all problems. What else is out there?
- Language choice is often determined by network effect: what we can code because others are using it and we need to talk to others.
- Water cooler chat. That ability to hold your own against seasoned pros.

## What is a programming paradigm and why should we care?
> "A definition"
A design feature:


4 **main ones** data abstraction, functional encapsulation, concurrency, and named state (everything time related, not crank-the-handle identical treatment function),

Why are they important?
- They are the design choices that language designers make.
- Ultimately what defines languages: makes SQL great at transacting large amounts of structured data, makes C lightening quick,
And JavaScript so ubiquitous (just kidding that was just dumb luck and the growth of the internet [watch this lite history of JavaScript 12min YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh6lK57Cuk4))



## The authors really like their own language, Oz
