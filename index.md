Hi, welcome to my personal blog! Thanks for stopping by.

A flexible framework is an idea of programming nirvana. The application structure, pattern and approach is _just right_. It is flexible enough to meet as-yet unknown extensions but rigid and framework-y enough to meet the current challenge.

The extension (.xyz) is because it is multi-dimensional (geddit, cartesian co-ordinate axes) and conveniently also one of the cheapest domain name extensions available on (NameCheap)[https://www.namecheap.com/].

Some more [about me](about/).
