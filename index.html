<p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog! Thanks for stopping by. Its a broad collection of thoughts and things I am interested in and doing.</p>

<p>Some words <a href="about/">about me</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-flexible-framework">What’s a “flexible framework”?</h2>
<p>A flexible framework is an idea of programming nirvana. The application structure, pattern and approach is <em>just right</em>.  Its a balance between getting the design flexible enough to meet as-yet unknown extensions but rigid and framework-y enough to meet the current challenge.
The concept really applies beyond programming: you don’t want to over-engineer but you want something nice to use and performant.</p>

<p>The extension (.xyz) is because it is multi-dimensional (geddit, cartesian co-ordinate axes) and conveniently also one of the cheapest extensions available!</p>
