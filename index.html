<p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog! Thanks for stopping by.</p>

<p>This blog is a new project and I am going to start by writing a series of “introductions to X” posts to help me find my writing voice and prove my own blogging pipeline and processes.</p>

<p>Some words <a href="about/">about me and this blog</a> and a <a href="&quot;/assets/AHughes_CV_external_201902 - no refs no contact.pdf&quot;">recent CV</a></p>

<p><strong>why “flexible framework”?</strong> A flexible framework is a programming nirvana. The application structure and coding patterns are <em>just right</em>.  Its a balance between getting the design flexible enough to meet as-yet unknown extensions but rigid and framework-y enough to meet the current challenge.
The concept really applies beyond programming: you don’t want to over-engineer but you want something nice to use right now.</p>

<p><strong>why “.xys”?</strong> The extension (.xyz) is because this blog will cover many dimensions (geddit, cartesian axes) and conveniently .xyz was one of the cheapest extensions available.</p>
