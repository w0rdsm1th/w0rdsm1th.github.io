<p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog! Thanks for stopping by. Its a broad collection of thoughts and things I am interested in and doing.</p>

<p>Some words <a href="about/">about me</a> and a <a href="/assets/AHughes_CV_external_201902 - no refs no contact.pdf">recent CV</a></p>

<p><strong>why “flexible framework”?</strong> A flexible framework is a programming nirvana. The application structure and coding patterns are <em>just right</em>.  Its a balance between getting the design flexible enough to meet as-yet unknown extensions but rigid and framework-y enough to meet the current challenge.
The concept really applies beyond programming: you don’t want to over-engineer but you want something nice to use and performant.</p>

<p><strong>why “.xys”?</strong> The extension (.xyz) is because it is multi-dimensional (geddit, cartesian co-ordinate axes) and conveniently also one of the cheapest extensions available!</p>
