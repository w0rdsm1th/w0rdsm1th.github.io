<p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog! Thanks for stopping by.</p>

<p>A flexible framework is an idea of programming nirvana. The application structure, pattern and approach is <em>just right</em>. It is flexible enough to meet as-yet unknown extensions but rigid and framework-y enough to meet the current challenge.
I suppose this concept applies beyond programming: you donâ€™t want to over-engineer but you want something nice to use and performant.</p>

<p>The extension (.xyz) is because it is multi-dimensional (geddit, cartesian co-ordinate axes) and conveniently also one of the cheapest domain name extensions available from my DNS provider.</p>

<p>Its also hopefully flexible enough of a name to cover my as-yet-unknown future interests: unicycle polo anyone?</p>

<p>Some words <a href="about/">about me</a>.</p>
