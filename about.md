## who am i?

I am a data scientist located in London, UK. Interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and general programming languages and paradigms.

I have an open mind to the future and direction of data science e.g. automated ML. I also recognise that it's not all plain sailing. There are inherent risks and blindspots to ML development and adoption e.g. Cathy O'Neil's [Weapons of Math(s) Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/).

Cheesy but I really think the modern combination of abundant computing power and widely tracked and available data points make Data Science a really exciting field. There are new problems and new ways of looking at decisions that can have a bit (hopefully positive) impact on humanity.

Otherwise I like food (coffee is a food right?), bikes and basketball.

## what is this?
The name comes from a concept of programming nirvanna. An old boss always deliberated over getting the application structure, pattern and approach *just right*.

The extension (.xyz) is because it is multi-dimensional (geddit, cartesian co-ordinate axes) and coincidentally one of the cheapest domain name extensions available.

## what can we expect?
- short: sum 600 words or 10 minutes

- practical: code snippets, an embedded and talked-about powerful visual

- standing on shoulders of giants: trying to cite my sources as openly as possible. I see a lot of posts that basically clone and tweak. Sometimes tweeks are opinionated and make better, sometimes they pointless.

- in style of Francois Chollet, Peter Norvig.
