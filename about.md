I am a data scientist located in London, UK. I'm specifically interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and general programming languages and paradigms.

It's clich√© but I think the modern-day combination of abundant computing power and widely tracked and available data points make Data Science an exciting and promising field. There are new problems and new ways of making decisions that can have a big (hopefully positive) impact on humanity.

I have an open mind to the future and direction of data science e.g. automated ML. I also recognise that it's not all plain sailing. There are inherent risks and blindspots to ML development and adoption e.g. Cathy O'Neil's [Weapons of Math(s) Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/).

Otherwise I like food (coffee is a food right?), bicycles and basketball.

## what can we expect?
- list of my current posts tags: TODO <!-- {{ site.tags }} -->  
- short: posts are <1000 words or ~7 minute read. Which seems _[just right](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b)_.
- practical: embedded code snippets and a couple (not too many) visuals.
- accessible and informed writing style: aiming Francois Chollet, Peter Norvig, Alex Martelli.
- open: trying to cite my sources and improvements as openly as possible. I see a lot of online posts that basically clone and tweak. Sometimes tweaks are opinionated and make better, sometimes they are pointless.
