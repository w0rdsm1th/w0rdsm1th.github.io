## who am i?

I am a data scientist located in London, UK. I'm interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and general programming languages and paradigms.

It's cheesy but I really think the modern combination of abundant computing power and widely tracked and available data points make Data Science a really exciting field. There are new problems and new ways of looking at decisions that can have a bit (hopefully positive) impact on humanity.

I have an open mind to the future and direction of data science e.g. automated ML. I also recognise that it's not all plain sailing. There are inherent risks and blindspots to ML development and adoption e.g. Cathy O'Neil's [Weapons of Math(s) Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/).

Otherwise I like food (coffee is a food right?), bicycles and basketball.

:smiley:

## what is this?
The name comes from an idea of programming nirvanna: the application structure, pattern and approach is _just right_. It is flexible enough to meet as-yet unknown extensions or requirements but rigid and framework-y enough to meet the current challenge.

The extension (.xyz) is because it is multi-dimensional (geddit, cartesian co-ordinate axes) and conveniently also one of the cheapest domain name extensions available on (NameCheap.com)[https://www.namecheap.com/].

## what can we expect?
- list of my current posts tags: {{ site.tags }}

- short: posts are <1000 words or ~7 minute read. Which seems _[just right](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b)_.

- practical: embedded code snippets and a couple (not too many) visuals.

- aiming for style of Francois Chollet, Peter Norvig: hella informed, real accessible.

- open: trying to cite my sources and improvements as openly as possible. I see a lot of online posts that basically clone and tweak. Sometimes tweaks are opinionated and make better, sometimes they are pointless.
